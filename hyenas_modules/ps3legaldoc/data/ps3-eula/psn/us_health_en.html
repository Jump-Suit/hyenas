<h2>Health Warnings</h2>
<h3>WARNING: PHOTOSENSITIVITY/EPILEPSY SEIZURES</h3>
<p>A very small percentage of individuals may experience epileptic 
seizures or blackouts when exposed to certain light patterns or flashing
 lights. Exposure to certain patterns or backgrounds on a television 
screen or when playing video games may trigger epileptic seizures or 
blackouts in these individuals. These conditions may trigger previously 
undetected epileptic symptoms or seizures in persons who have no history
 of prior seizures or epilepsy. If you, or anyone in your family has an 
epileptic condition or has had seizures of any kind, consult your 
physician before playing. </p>
<p>IMMEDIATELY DISCONTINUE use and consult your physician before 
resuming gameplay. If you or your child experience any of the following 
health problems or symptoms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dizziness</li>
<li>Altered vision</li>
<li>Eye or muscle twitches</li>
<li>Loss of awareness</li>
<li>Disorientation</li>
<li>Seizures or</li>
<li>Any involuntary movement or convulsion</li>
</ul>
<p>RESUME GAME PLAY ONLY ON APPROVAL OF YOUR PHYSICIAN.</p>
<p>Use and handling of video games to reduce the likelihood of a seizure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use in a well-lit area and keep as far away as possible from the television screen.</li>
<li>Avoid large screen televisions. Use the smallest television screen available.</li>
<li>Avoid prolonged use of the PlayStation® system.</li>
<li>Take a 15-minute break during each hour of play.</li>
<li>Avoid playing when you are tired or need sleep.</li>
</ul>
<p>Stop using the system immediately if you experience any of the 
following symptoms: lightheadedness, nausea, or a sensation similar to 
motion sickness, discomfort or pain in the eyes, ears, hands arms, or 
any other part of the body. If the condition persists, consult a doctor.</p>
<h3>VR Headset Safety Notice</h3>
<p>Before using, read the health and safety warnings in the VR headset 
instruction manual. Carefully follow all instructions for setup and use.</p>
<p>The VR headset is not for use by children under age 12.</p>
<p>Review surroundings and clear obstacles before use. Take steps to 
prevent pets, children, or other obstacles entering the area during use.</p>
<p>Some people may experience motion sickness, nausea, disorientation, 
blurred vision or other discomfort while viewing virtual reality 
content. If you experience any of these symptoms, stop using immediately
 and remove the VR headset.</p>
<h3>SIXAXIS™ Controller and DUALSHOCK® Wireless Controller WARNING</h3>
<p>When using the SIXAXIS™ or DUALSHOCK® wireless controller motion 
sensor function, be cautious of the following points. If the controller 
hits a person or object, this may cause accidental injury or damage. 
Before using, check that there is plenty of space around you. When using
 the controller, grip it firmly to make sure it cannot slip out of your 
hand. If using a controller that is connected to the PlayStation® system
 with a USB cable, make sure there is enough space for the cable so that
 the cable will not hit a person or object. Also, take care to avoid 
pulling the cable out of the PlayStation® system while using the 
controller.</p>
<h3>PlayStation®Move SAFETY NOTICE</h3>
<p>When using the motion controller, avoid holding the controller closer
 than 8 inches from your face or eyes. If the motion controller hits a 
person or an object, it may cause accidental injury or damage. Before 
using, check that there is plenty of space around you. Hold the 
controller firmly to prevent it from slipping out of your hand.  Always 
wear the strap and tighten the strap with the strap lock.</p>
<h3>3D DEVICE USE NOTICE</h3>
<p>Some people may experience discomfort (such as eye strain, eye 
fatigue or nausea) while watching 3D video images or playing 
stereoscopic 3D games on 3D televisions. If you experience such 
discomfort, you should immediately discontinue use of your television 
until the discomfort subsides.</p>
<p>Sony Interactive Entertainment ("SIE") recommends that all viewers 
take regular breaks while watching 3D video or playing stereoscopic 3D 
games. The length and frequency of necessary breaks may vary from person
 to person. Please take breaks that are long enough to allow any 
feelings of discomfort to subside. If symptoms persist, consult a 
doctor.</p>
<p>The vision of young children (especially those under six years old) 
is still under development. SIE recommends that you consult your doctor 
(such as a pediatrician or eye doctor) before allowing young children to
 watch 3D video images or play stereoscopic 3D games. Adults should 
supervise young children to ensure they follow the recommendations 
listed above.</p>
