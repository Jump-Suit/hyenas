<h3><strong>PLAYSTATION</strong>â„¢<strong>NETWORK TERMS OF SERVICE AND USER AGREEMENT</strong></h3>
<h3>1.  ABOUT THIS AGREEMENT</h3>
<p>1.1  Please read this entire agreement and indicate whether you 
accept its terms. It is a contract between you and Sony Interactive 
Entertainment LLC ("SIE"). Access to and use of PlayStation Network 
("PSN") is expressly conditioned upon acceptance of this agreement.  You
 accept this agreement by creating an account for PSN ("Account"), by 
making a purchase on the PlayStation Store, or through any other use of 
PSN, or by continuing to use PSN after being notified of a change to 
these terms. If you do not agree to these terms, you will not be able to
 create an Account and will not be able to access PSN or its products or
 services. </p>
<p>1.2  PLEASE CAREFULLY READ THE BINDING ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS 
ACTION WAIVER IN SECTION 14. IT AFFECTS HOW DISPUTES ARE RESOLVED 
BETWEEN YOU AND SIE (AND ITS CURRENT OR FORMER AFFILIATES, PARENTS, OR 
SUBSIDIARIES), AND INFORMS YOU OF YOUR OPT-OUT RIGHTS. </p>
<p>NOTE: Depending on where you reside, you may have rights under 
applicable local laws that cannot be limited or waived. Nothing in this 
Agreement limits any such rights under those local laws.</p>
<p>1.3  To accept this Terms of Service and User Agreement and create an
 account for PSN, you must be at least 18 years of age and have reached 
the legal age of majority in the country in which your account is 
registered. </p>
<p>If you are younger than 18, or have not yet reached the legal age of 
majority in the country in which your account is registered, your parent
 or legal guardian must create an account for you and agree to these 
terms of service in order for you to use PSN. Before you begin to use 
your Account, ask your parent or guardian to explain these Terms to you.
 We also encourage you to review the PSN Rules at 
https://www.playstation.com/legal/psn-rules/.  </p>
<p>1.4  In addition to this Terms of Service and User Agreement 
("Agreement" or "Terms"), the following terms apply and form part of 
your contract with us: (a) the System Software License Agreement, which 
governs the use of the software embedded in a PlayStation, PlayStation 
2, PlayStation Portable, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, PlayStation 
TV, PlayStation Classic, PlayStation 4, or PlayStation 5 system (a 
"PlayStation Device"); and (b) all applicable Software Product License 
Agreements (which govern your use of PlayStation game, mobile, and 
application software developed to operate on an PlayStation Device). 
Copies of these documents can be found at www.playstation.com/legal. We 
may also require that you agree to additional content-specific or 
service-specific terms or policies ("Usage Terms") in order to access 
some services or products available on PSN. By accessing those services 
or products, you agree that the applicable Usage Terms become part of 
this Agreement and govern your access and use of them. </p>
<p>1.5  By accepting this agreement, you affirm that you: (a) are at 
least 18 years of age and have reached the legal age of majority; (b) 
that you have read this Agreement and agree to abide by its terms and 
the other terms incorporated into it by reference; and (c) that you have
 reviewed and consent to the SIE LLC Privacy Policy (found at 
www.playstation.com/legal).  </p>
<p>If you are accepting this Agreement on behalf of a child under 18 
("child"), you also (a) represent that you are the parent or legal 
guardian of the child; (b) affirm that you accept this Agreement and 
consent to the SIE LLC Privacy Policy on behalf of your child; and (c) 
accept all liability for their actions on PSN and compliance with these 
terms.</p>
<p>1.6  Breach of these Terms by you or your Child (if accepting these 
Terms on behalf of a child) may result in the temporary or permanent 
suspension of your console or your Account, including any accounts you 
may have set up for a child under 18 ("Child Accounts") under your 
Account, and loss of access to the content associated with those 
Accounts.  See Section 12 for more information.</p>
<h3>2.  PSN SERVICES AND THIRD-PARTY SERVICES ON PSN</h3>
<p>2.1  PSN Services include PlayStation Network, PlayStation Store, 
PlayStation Plus, PlayStation Music, PlayStation Video, PlayStation Now,
 PlayStation Direct, and those websites, products and services that SIE,
 and its affiliates offer through or in connection with PSN or your 
Account. </p>
<p>2.2  We may also provide access (paid or unpaid) to content, 
products, or services offered by publishers or entities other than SIE 
and its affiliates ("Third-Party Services"). When you use PSN or your 
Account to access Third-Party Services, the applicable terms of this 
Agreement and any applicable Usage Terms will govern your use of that 
Service. </p>
<p>2.3  PSN Content includes the games, music, movies, services 
(including PSN Services and Third-party Services), virtual currency, 
vouchers, virtual communities, and other digital products or content 
through PSN. Availability of PSN, its features, and its Content, varies 
depending on which PlayStation Device or other device you are using to 
access PSN, and is subject to change at any time. Some PSN Content and 
features may not be available or supported in your country or language. 
Additional purchases may be required to access certain PSN Content or 
features. </p>
<p>2.4  SIE does not endorse Third-Party Services promoted or marketed on PSN or through PSN Content.</p>
<h3>3.  ACCOUNT CREATION AND SECURITY</h3>
<p>3.1  All information provided during Account creation must be 
accurate. We reserve the right to terminate any Account that uses or was
 created using false information, or that we determine was created for a
 purpose that violates this Agreement. </p>
<p>3.2  During Account creation you must select the region in which your
 account will be registered in. Once your account is created, you will 
not be able to change the country or region code associated with your 
account.</p>
<p>3.3  All users should safeguard their Account sign-in ID ("PSN ID") 
password and take steps to prevent access to your Account by other 
persons on any shared devices. To help protect your Account from 
unauthorized transactions you can turn on "Require Password at Checkout"
 in your Account settings. We have no liability for any unauthorized 
usage of any Account. </p>
<p>3.4  If we believe your account has been compromised, we may take 
actions to protect you and SIE. Such actions may include resetting 
Account passwords; canceling subscriptions; suspending accounts or 
restricting Account activities or access. We may also upload updates to 
your PlayStation Devices to stop unauthorized use of your Account or 
prevent PlayStation Devices from connecting to PSN.</p>
<p>3.5  SIE has the right to deny the creation of any Account, for any reason, in its sole discretion.</p>
<h3>4.  CHILD ACCOUNTS AND PARENTAL CONTROLS</h3>
<p>4.1  If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child who will 
access PSN, you are responsible for creating a Child Account for them.  
If you have more than one child, you will need to create a separate 
Child Account for each one. In order to create a Child Account, you will
 first need to set up an Account for yourself.   </p>
<p>4.2  Your child must meet certain age requirements when you create an
 Account for him or her. More information about creating and managing 
Accounts for child family members on PSN is available at 
www.playstation.com/support.</p>
<p>4.3  Some content on PSN may be inappropriate for younger users. We 
offer a variety of settings which you can use to tailor your Child's 
experience and activities on PSN as may be appropriate for their age 
("Parental Controls"). Visit www.playstation.com/safety to learn how to 
set up Parental Controls.</p>
<p>4.4  Parental Control features and restriction settings differ based 
on the device you use to access PSN, and are subject to availability, 
including availability in the country in which your Account is 
registered. Some content that you access on your PlayStation Device or 
via tablet, cell phone, or other device may be accessible by all users 
of that system or device, and Parental Controls on those devices may not
 apply to certain types of content. </p>
<p>4.5  Parental Controls may allow you to restrict your Child's access 
to certain rated game and video content by using restrict-content 
settings. However, not all content is rated, and Parental Controls may 
not apply to unrated content. In some cases, third parties provide the 
content ratings or descriptions for items, and we cannot guarantee the 
accuracy or completeness of that information. </p>
<p>4.6  Parental Controls allow you to set a monthly spending limit for 
Child Accounts. The default spending limit is zero. If you choose to 
increase the spending limit on a Child Account you are (a) representing 
that your child understands that they will be charged the listed price 
for any purchase they make; (b) agreeing that you approve their ability 
to make purchases through their Account; and (c) agreeing to pay for all
 purchases up to the approved monthly spending limit.</p>
<p>4.7  Parental Controls set other restrictions for your child's 
Account, including control of communication features and online 
accessibility. More information about Parental Controls is available 
through your Account settings pages and in our online user guides. 
Please visit our PlayStation Safety page at www.playstation.com/safety 
for information on what Parental Controls are available on your 
PlayStation Device. </p>
<p>4.8  As the parent or legal guardian of a Child with an account for 
PSN, you are responsible for monitoring your Child's access to and use 
of PSN, as well as any communications made or received by your Child 
through PSN. You are also responsible for the use of your Account by 
your Children or others that may have access to your Account or 
PlayStation Device. </p>
<p>4.9  You are responsible for explaining these Terms to your Child, 
especially the Community Code of Conduct in Section 5 ("Code of 
Conduct"), and ensuring they understand how to behave when interacting 
with PSN. If your Child violates these Terms, we may take moderation 
action against their Account or console (see Section 12 for more 
information).</p>
<p>4.10  Your child can also review our PSN Rules at 
https://www.playstation.com/legal/psn-rules/. The PSN Rules do not 
contain the full Terms, but they highlight the most important parts for 
our younger users.</p>
<h3>5.  CODE OF CONDUCT</h3>
<p>PSN is for everyone, regardless of race, gender identity, sexual 
orientation, ethnicity, nationality, color, immigration status, social 
and economic class, educational level, size, family status, political 
belief, religion, and mental and physical ability or any other attribute
 that people use to label others or divide communities. </p>
<p>In order to keep PSN the best place to play for everyone, it is 
important for all our users to respect the rights of others and refrain 
from misuse of PSN. Accordingly, when you create an Account you agree

for any reason, including for the purpose of gaining an unfair advantage
 in a game.</p>

 in nature, such as advertisements, solicitations, promotions, and links
 to web sites.</p>

its affiliates or their licensors, or players, such as any code or virus
 that may damage, alter or change any property or interfere with the use

<p>Violations of our Code of Conduct may result in moderation action 
taken against your Account or your PlayStation Devices (see Section 12 
for more information). We may also notify law enforcement (or another 
appropriate government agency) if the breach involves a threat to the 
life or safety of yourself or others, or any other activity that we 
believe to be unlawful.  </p>
<p>We are not responsible for monitoring or recording any activity or 
communications on PSN, although we may do so in order to investigate 
violations of or enforce this Agreement, or to protect the rights and 
property of SIE, its partners, and customers. If you witness or 
experience any violation of this Code by another player, you should 
report them immediately, using our grief reporting tools. For more 
information on grief reporting please visit www.playstation.com/safety. 
We are not liable for any violation of this agreement by you or by any 
other PSN user.</p>
<h3>6.  USER INFORMATION AND USER GENERATED CONTENT</h3>
<p>6.1  User Information. </p>
<p>We may provide functionality allowing you to share information 
relating to your presence on PSN, in including your name, sign-in ID, 
Online ID, profile, pictures, friends list, communications and 
interactions (including by voice), activities, and information on your 
gameplay, purchases made and content viewed (collectively, "User 
Information"), or to recommend your favorite Content via PSN. Only share
 User Information with friends who you know want to receive it, and 
whose age is appropriate for the Content you are sharing. </p>
<p>You may have an opportunity to share or permit us to share your User 
Information relating to your Account or activities on PSN via 
Third-Party Services. If you choose to do so, use or distribution of 
your Information on any Third-Party Service may be subject solely to 
that third party's terms of service and privacy policy; please review 
those documents before sharing your Information. You hereby authorize us
 to use, distribute, copy, display, and publish your User Information, 
without payment to you.</p>
<p>Some Content on PSN may have features that allow your User 
Information to be recorded by a user and distributed to any third party 
publicly, including users outside of PSN. You agree that any third party
 may record, use and distribute your information for any reason without 
any restrictions or compensation to you. Additional terms may apply, 
including the terms of any game publisher or service provider. Please 
review all terms carefully. If you do not want your information to be 
used, recorded or distributed, please do not use or access PSN.</p>
<p>6.2  User Generated Content. </p>
<p>We may provide functionality that allows you to create, post, or 
transmit content such as text, messages, comments, screenshots, 
pictures, photographs, voice, music, videos, streams, gameplay and 
game-related information and other materials created by you or others, 
and/or shared by you or others, via PSN or select Third-Party Services 
("UGC"). By utilizing such functionality, you grant SIE a royalty-free, 
perpetual, global license to use, distribute, copy, modify, display, and
 publish your UGC for any reason, without further notice or payment to 
you or any third parties. You further authorize SIE to sublicense its 
rights to any third party, including its affiliates. You hereby waive, 
to the extent permitted by applicable law, all claims, including any 
moral or patrimonial rights, against SIE, and its affiliates for SIE's, 
its affiliates, or any third party's use of UGC. By creating, posting, 
streaming, or transmitting any UGC, you represent and warrant that you 
have the appropriate rights to use, create, post, distribute, and 
transmit UGC and to grant the foregoing license, and that doing so does 
not infringe the rights of any third party or violate any law. </p>
<p>6.3  We reserve the right to suppress, block, hide, remove, or delete
 any User Information or UGC at our discretion, and to report any 
illegal UGC and related User Information to the appropriate authorities.</p>
<p>6.4  You agree to cooperate in resolving any dispute that may arise from your User Information or UGC. </p>
<h3>7.  VIRTUAL WALLET</h3>
<p>7.1  Your Account has an associated virtual wallet, which can store 
funds from an outside payment method (e.g., credit card, PayPal 
Account), or from vouchers or prepaid card redemptions ("PSN Wallet").  
Child Accounts that are associated with your Account do not have a 
separate wallet.  All purchases made by any associated Child Accounts 
will be made through your PSN Wallet.</p>
<p>7.2  Wallet Funds have no value outside PSN and can only be used to 
make purchases through PSN Services or certain Third-Party Services. You
 can only hold a certain maximum amount of funds in your wallet as 
determined by us ("Limit"), using either (i) a credit or debit card; 
(ii) a prepaid card or promotional code with a specified value where 
available; or (iii) other payment methods approved by us and made 
available from time to time in each specific country. </p>
<p>7.3  FUNDS ADDED TO THE PSN WALLET ARE NON-REFUNDABLE AND 
NON-TRANSFERABLE EXCEPT WHERE THE LAW REQUIRES. WE HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO
 REVERSE OR REFUND UNAUTHORIZED CHARGES MADE USING ANY PAYMENT METHOD TO
 FUND THE WALLET. WALLET FUNDS THAT ARE DEEMED ABANDONED OR UNUSED BY 
LAW WILL NOT BE RETURNED OR RESTORED.</p>
<h3>8.  PLAYSTATION STORE</h3>
<p>8.1  Access and Use. </p>
<p>PlayStation Store is where you can buy digital games, subscriptions, 
virtual currency, and other digital content. You can pay for purchases 
on PlayStation Store using PSN Wallet funds or any other payment method 
we may identify as acceptable on the Store (an "Approved Payment 
Method").  You must be signed into your Account to complete your 
purchase.  If you delete or close your Account, you may lose access to 
and use of any purchased Content. </p>
<p>8.2  Account Linking. </p>
<p>If a third party publishes a Product you purchase, you may need to 
associate or link your account for PSN to an account with that third 
party to use that Product. The Product may become linked to that 
third-party account as well as the purchasing account. If you unlink the
 third-party account from your account for PSN, or if your third-party 
account is closed or deleted, you may lose access to the Product.</p>
<p>8.3  Purchase Terms. </p>
<p>By completing a transaction through your Account or allowing a 
transaction to take place through an associated Child Account, you are 
(i) agreeing to pay for all transactions made by you or your children; 
(ii) authorizing SIE to deduct from the Wallet and charge your Approved 
Payment Method all fees due and payable for all your transactions; and 
(iii) agreeing to the terms of this Agreement, including any applicable 
Usage Terms or Third-Party Terms associated with use of the particular 
Product. All transactions may be deemed to be governed by law and 
regulatory requirements applicable at the time the transaction was 
completed. </p>
<p>8.4  No Resale or Commercial Use. </p>
<p>You must be an end user to purchase from PlayStation Store.  
Resellers, as determined by us in our sole discretion, are prohibited. 
When you order Content from PlayStation Store, you buy a personal 
license to use that Content for private, non-commercial use. That 
license is not transferable unless your local applicable laws say it 
must be. This means you can use a Product in the ways described in the 
license, but do not own the Product.</p>
<p>8.5  Cancellations and Refunds. </p>
<p>All purchases from the PlayStation Store are final and non-refundable
 except as stated in this Agreement or the then-current PlayStation 
Store Cancellation Policy (found at 
https://www.playstation.com/legal/cancellation-policy). </p>
<p>8.6  Pre-orders and Bundles. </p>
<p>You may have the option to order certain Content in the form of 
bundles (such as seasons of television series) or a pre-order. You will 
be charged for the Content at the time of the order, but some of the 
content may not be available until the listed release date.</p>
<p>8.7  Safeguarding Credit Card Transactions. </p>
<p>On some devices, you may have the option to select a password or PIN 
to protect your credit card information at the time you complete a 
transaction. After selecting this option, you must enter your password 
or PIN to complete any future transactions with your credit card. Enable
 this function to prevent others who may use the same device from being 
able to make purchases or access your credit card information. </p>
<p>8.8  Fees and Other Charges. </p>
<p>You are responsible for all bank fees related to any transactions or 
failed transactions (e.g., chargebacks from your bank or credit card 
provider) initiated by you or your children, including domestic and 
international transaction fees. We may suspend your console or Account 
(including any associated Child Accounts) for failure to pay transaction
 fees. We may also elect to provide a mechanism by which you fund the 
wallet associated with your Account to prevent your Account (and any 
associated Child Accounts) from being terminated. </p>
<p>8.9  Price Drops and Errors. </p>
<p>The price applicable to your transaction will be the price that was 
in effect at the time of the transaction.  If the price for any content 
or services you purchased temporarily or permanently drops, you will not
 be entitled to a refund (unless your purchase independently qualifies 
for a refund under the PlayStation Store Cancellation Policy).   </p>
<p>If we discover an error in the price of items you have ordered, we 
will contact you. You will have the option of either reconfirming your 
order at the correct price or canceling it. If we are unable to contact 
you, your order will be automatically cancelled.</p>
<p>8.10  Sales Offers. </p>
<p>Special products and sales prices and promotions are no longer valid 
once they are changed or removed, or after any end date or time 
specified in the offer. </p>
<p>8.11  Subscriptions.</p>
<p>We may offer you the opportunity to purchase subscriptions (which may
 also be referred to as "memberships" or "services") that provide access
 to certain content, products or services for a specified period of 
time. Unless otherwise stated, subscriptions continue indefinitely. You 
will be charged the applicable subscription fee automatically, at the 
recurring interval applicable to the subscription, until you cancel.  </p>
<p>If you do not have sufficient funds in your wallet to cover the cost 
of your subscription at the time the subscription is renewed, the 
subscription will be cancelled unless you have an Approved Payment 
Method on file and the automatic funding feature on your Account set to 
"ON." If your automatic funding feature is "ON", we will charge the 
balance of any renewal fee to the Approved Payment Method you have on 
file (this does not apply to subscription purchases made by Child 
Accounts). Every time you buy a subscription, redeem a voucher for a 
subscription, or initiate a trial of a subscription from PlayStation 
Store, we turn "On" Automatic Funding in your Account Settings (even if 
you previously turned it "OFF"). You can switch Automatic Funding "Off" 
again at any time.  </p>
<p>Upon cancellation of a subscription, you will not be able to access 
content or services provided with your subscription except as permitted 
by us. Content that you downloaded onto a device and that was provided 
to you through a subscription at no additional cost beyond the 
subscription price may not be accessible. Gameplay information, 
including trophies earned during a trial offer, promotional period or 
subscription term may not be available.  Further information about 
managing your subscriptions is available at www.playstation.com/support.</p>
<p>You may not share your subscription with other Accounts, including 
associated Child Accounts. However, some content and features that are 
made available for certain subscriptions may be accessible by other 
users of the PlayStation Device of a subscriber or a PlayStation Device 
where a subscriber is logged in.</p>
<p>Subscriptions may come with their own Usage Terms and/or Privacy 
Policy.  Please make sure to read these agreements carefully before you 
subscribe.</p>
<p>8.12  Free Trials.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise stated at the time of purchase, free trials will 
automatically convert into paid subscriptions at the end of the trial 
period.  To avoid being charged, you must cancel your subscription prior
 to the expiration of the trial period. Please review all applicable 
terms carefully before you sign up for a free trial.</p>
<p>8.13  Virtual Items. </p>
<p>Any attempt to obtain Virtual Items outside of the applicable game, 
the app, or PlayStation Store is prohibited. Virtual Items have no value
 or application outside of the game or PlayStation Store, and may not be
 sold, transferred or redeemed for real money or items of value. Virtual
 Items may be modified or removed without notice.  </p>
<p>8.14  Tax.  </p>
<p>Prices listed do not include sales tax. Applicable sales tax will be 
calculated and added at the time you complete a transaction. In certain 
jurisdictions, local laws require that prices include all applicable 
taxes, in which case this will be indicated at the time of the 
transaction. </p>
<p>8.15  Transaction Records. </p>
<p>You may make transactions only with the designated SIE regional 
company that is determined by the country/area of residence to which 
your account is registered.  Your country/area of residence may be 
verified by your credit or debit card number and may be rejected if the 
information does not match. Please retain any transaction related 
communications we may send to you. Your transaction history is also 
available in your Account management areas.</p>
<p>8.16  Access to Purchased Items. </p>
<p>Upon our confirmation of your transaction, and subject to the 
applicable Usage Terms, you may access the PSN Content you ordered 
through the Account that you used to complete the order. You bear all 
risk of loss for accessing the content, and for any loss of content you 
have downloaded, including any loss due to a file corruption or hard 
drive crash. You are solely responsible if you do not choose to download
 or access the content before it is removed or your license expires, and
 for the authorized ongoing storage and safekeeping of the content. We 
are not obligated to provide you with replacement copies for any reason.</p>
<p>8.17  Payment Methods. </p>
<p>If you have funds in your PSN Wallet, you may use those funds to 
complete a purchase or renew a subscription.  If you do not have enough 
funds in your Wallet to complete a transaction, we may automatically 
charge your Approved Payment Method for the balance necessary to 
complete the purchase. </p>
<p>We participate in account update services offered by some banks to 
help keep your payment cards up to date on your Account. Where you have 
added a payment card as a payment method to your Account and if your 
bank participates, we may automatically update your card number or 
expiration date in our system when your card expires. Following any 
update, we will continue to charge the applicable payment methods to any
 purchases you make unless you notify us otherwise. You can opt out of

restrictions are described below. More information about these 
restrictions and accessing Video Content is available at 
www.playstation.com/support. </p>
<p>11.4  Live Stream Content. </p>
<p>Live Stream Content comprises live or near-live transmissions of Live
 Events. When you access Live Stream Content, you may not be able to 
view any part of the Live Stream Content that occurred prior to the 
start of your viewing. We have no control over the start and finish time
 of a Live Event; the duration of a Live Event; the content of a Live 
Event (including the availability, quality or suitability of the content
 or that it complies with applicable law); or that the Live Stream 
Content be delivered uninterrupted, error-free and without fault or 
delay.</p>
<p>11.5  Ad Supported Content. </p>
<p>Ad Supported Content is Video Content that contains or is displayed 
with advertising, marketing or other promotional materials (together, 
the "Promotional Materials"). Ad Supported Content may be limited such 
that it is accessible by only one Authorized Device at any one time. 
Promotional Materials may be displayed in or around Ad Supported Content
 by any means selected by us or its Ad Supported Content Partners 
(defined below). You acknowledge that Ad Supported Content may include, 
comprise or be displayed with Promotional Materials that may delay or 
interrupt its playback. We may prevent you from skipping or manipulating
 the display of Promotional Materials, and, if so, you may not attempt 
to access Ad Supported Content in any manner not prescribed by us. We do
 not endorse any third-party advertising or promotional material 
(including the Promotional Materials) associated with Ad Supported 
Content in any manner and give no warranty or other assurance in 
relation to any products or services featured in these advertisements 
and promotional materials.</p>
<p>Certain Ad Supported Content may be hosted or delivered to you by or 
through third-party licensors, providers or partners ("Ad Supported 
Content Partners"). We have no control over the content hosted or 
delivered by the Ad Supported Content Partners (including all associated
 Promotional Materials, corresponding meta-data, artwork and other 
peripheral materials). We cannot guarantee that their content will be 
complete and accurate, comply with applicable laws, correspond to its 
description, be suitable or appropriate for a particular age group, or 
be delivered uninterrupted, error-free and without fault or delay. </p>
<p>11.6  Licensed Rental Content. </p>
<p>Licensed Rental Content is subject to restrictions regarding when 
playback can be initiated post purchase, and once initiated, the time 
period during which Licensed Rental Content can be accessed ("Rental 
Terms"). Licensed Rental Content can only be viewed within the time 
periods specified in the Rental Terms. The Rental Terms differ based on 
the type of Licensed Rental Content and the Authorized Device you use to
 access the Licensed Rental Content. Please review carefully any product
 descriptions, the Rental Terms, and any applicable Usage Terms made 
available for each Licensed Rental Content prior to finalizing your 
rental payment. </p>
<p>You may select the Authorized Device on which you want to view your 
Licensed Rental Content, but you may view it on only one Authorized 
Device at a time, and in some cases on a limited number of Authorized 
Devices. Licensed Rental Content is also subject to restrictions 
regarding transferability between Authorized Devices. Once playback of 
Licensed Rental Content in a particular format has started on an 
Authorized Device, you may not be able to view that content using any 
other Authorized Device without a separate license payment. </p>
<p>11.7  Other Licensed Content. </p>
<p>Other Licensed Content may be downloaded or streamed to Authorized 
Devices. For Other Licensed Content that is downloaded, you may be able 
to view that content for a limited number of times on certain Authorized
 Devices only. For Other Licensed Content that is streamed, you may be 
prohibited from streaming multiple titles of Other Licensed Content or 
multiple streams of a single title of Other Licensed Content from your 
Account at any one time. After ordering Other Licensed Content, we 
encourage you to immediately download the content, where supported, on 
all Authorized Devices on which you may want to later view it. In some 
cases, Other Licensed Content may not be available for subsequent 
copying or downloading to additional Authorized Devices. Access to Other
 Licensed Content that has been purchased may also be subject to 
compatibility between the Authorized Device and the video format of the 
Other Licensed Content, continued availability to the Other Licensed 
Content from our third-party licensors, and other applicable 
restrictions.</p>
<p>11.8  Technical Requirements. </p>
<p>Delivery of and your access to Video Content are dependent on 
variables not under our control, including the speed and availability of
 your broadband or network connection, compatibility between the format 
of the Video Content and the Authorized Device you use to access that 
Video Content, availability of Video Content from our third-party 
licensors, and any applicable restrictions that may be imposed on the 
Video Content from our third-party licensors. SIE is not responsible for
 any delays or technical difficulties in downloading, streaming, or 
viewing the Video Content related to these variables. YOU WILL NOT 
RECEIVE A REFUND OR CREDIT FOR ANY DOWNLOADED OR STREAMED CONTENT THAT 
YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO VIEW OR HAVE DIFFICULTY VIEWING DUE TO THESE 
UNCONTROLLABLE VARIABLES, UNLESS THE CONTENT IS FAULTY OR UNLESS THE LAW
 REQUIRES OTHERWISE. </p>
<p>You bear all responsibility for ensuring that you have the 
capabilities to view Video Content in the appropriate format, or at all.
 Please carefully review any Usage Terms and descriptions of Video 
Content made available to you before making any rental or purchase. 
Output of Video Content in certain formats may require additional 
equipment that is sold separately. </p>
<p>11.9  Proper activation of a supported Authorized Device by the 
Account that ordered the Video Content is required to download, stream 
or view the content. Video Content is connected to the Account used to 
order that content and cannot be transferred from one Account to 
another. Each Account can activate no more than the maximum number of 
Authorized Devices, and each Authorized Device can only be activated for
 a limited number of Accounts. </p>
<h3>12.  ACCOUNT TERMINATION, CONSOLE SUSPENSION, AND OTHER REMEDIAL ACTIONS</h3>
<p>12.1  Termination by You. </p>
<p>You may terminate your Account at any time by contacting PlayStation 
Support. The best way to request closure of an Account is by going to: 
support.playstation.com/livechatrequest. Please have the following 
information readily available: (a) Sign-in ID (email address); (b) PSN 
ID; and (c) account security information.  </p>
<p>12.2  Suspension or Termination of your Account or Console by SIE.  </p>
<p>We may suspend or terminate any PSN Account or PlayStation Device, or
 indefinitely suspend or discontinue online access to certain network 
features or services, in the event of a violation of this Agreement, or 
as may be reasonably necessary to protect our PSN users, our partners, 
our platform, or other SIE interests.  </p>
<p>12.3  Effect of Account Termination. </p>
<p>After your Account is terminated, you will not be able to access PSN.
 Any game ranking, scores, trophies, Virtual Items, including virtual 
currency balances (whether earned or purchased), subscriptions, or other
 information saved on, or requiring connection to, PSN will not be 
retained or accessible. Account termination is irreversible.</p>
<p>UPON TERMINATION OF YOUR ACCOUNT (OR ANY ASSOCIATED CHILD ACCOUNT)  
FOR ANY REASON, YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE A REFUND FOR ITEMS (INCLUDING 
SUBSCRIPTIONS, VIRTUAL ITEMS, AND PRE-PAID PRODUCTS OR SERVICES), VALUE 
ACCUMULATED ON IN-GAME ITEMS OR ANY UNUSED BALANCE IN YOUR WALLET, 
EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY LAW OR AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT. </p>
<p>12.4  Effect of Account Termination on Child Accounts. </p>
<p>Generally, termination of a Family Manager Account (i.e., the Account
 of an adult who creates a Child Account) will result in the termination
 of any associated Child Accounts. However, in some cases, <br>we may 
permit your associated Child Accounts to remain open. In those cases, 
you will remain liable for all their acts and purchases until the Child 
Accounts are terminated. Parental Control settings placed on Child 
Accounts prior to the termination or suspension of your Account will 
remain in place, and the Child Accounts will be permitted to use the 
remaining funds in your PSN Wallet subject to any limits that were put 
in place prior to your Account termination. However, you will not 
receive any correspondence from us about the Child Accounts' activities 
or purchases.</p>
<p>12.5  Console Suspension. </p>
<p>Upon suspension of your PlayStation Device, you will not be able to 
use that console to (a) access PSN with any Account (even if you create a
 new one); (b) play any games or game modes requiring online access; or 
(c) access any content that purchased from the PlayStation Store. You 
will still be able to play any disc games that run on your console, if 
they do not need to connect to PSN to run.</p>
<p>12.6  Other Remedial Actions. </p>
<p>If we determine that you or any of your associated Child Accounts 
have violated this Agreement (including the Community Code of Conduct, 
the Usage Terms, or any other incorporated terms), or that your actions 
have injured or damaged the PSN community, we reserve the right to take 
any action we believe necessary to remedy the violation or to protect 
SIE's interests, including: (a) the automatic removal or blockage of 
content associated with those Accounts; (b) implementation of upgrades 
or devices intended to discontinue unauthorized use; (c) the permanent 
or temporary disablement of access to any PSN Content or features; (d) 
notifying law enforcement or the appropriate regulatory authority; and 
(e) initiating legal action. </p>
<h3>13.  MAINTENANCE AND UPGRADES</h3>
<p>From time to time, it may become necessary to provide certain content
 to you to ensure that PSN, PSN Content, or your PlayStation Devices are
 functioning properly. Some content may be provided automatically 
without notice when you sign in. This content may include automatic 
updates or upgrades that may change your current operating system, cause
 a loss of data or content or cause a loss of functionalities or 
utilities. Upgrades or updates may be provided for system software for 
your PlayStation Device or other devices. Access or use to any system 
software is subject to terms of a separate end user license agreement. 
You authorize us to provide this content, updates and upgrades, and you 
acknowledge that we are not liable for any damages, loss of data or loss
 of functionalities arising from our delivery of these content, updates,
 upgrades and maintenance services. It is recommended that you regularly
 back up any archivable data.</p>
<p>We may indefinitely suspend, or discontinue online access to content 
or data associated with your PSN Account at any time, including for 
service deprecations, maintenance services, or upgrades, without prior 
notice or liability. We may also discontinue offering certain PSN 
Content or features.  For any PSN Content that uses online servers, we 
make no commitment to continue to make those servers available. In 
addition, we reserve the right to delete player account data that we 
determine to have been dormant.</p>
<h3>14.  BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION</h3>
<p>14.1  Purpose. </p>
<p>The term "Dispute" means any dispute, claim, or controversy between 
you and Sony Interactive Entertainment LLC, Sony Interactive 
Entertainment Inc., or any of their current or former affiliates, 
including parents or subsidiaries, and any predecessor or successor 
entity to any of the foregoing, including Sony Computer Entertainment 
America LLC, and Sony Interactive Entertainment America LLC 
(collectively, "Sony Entities") regarding PSN or PSN Content, or the use
 of any PlayStation Devices or other devices sold by a Sony Entity to 
access PSN Content, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, 
ordinance, tort (including fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent 
inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or equitable theory, and 
includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this "BINDING 
INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION" section (with the exception of the 
enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below). "Dispute" is to
 be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced. If you 
have a Dispute with any Sony Entity or any of a Sony Entity's officers, 
directors, employees and agents that cannot be resolved through 
negotiation within the time frame described in the "Notice of Dispute" 
clause below, you and the Sony Entity that you have a Dispute with agree
 to seek resolution of the Dispute only through arbitration of that 
Dispute in accordance with the terms of this section, and not litigate 
any Dispute in court, except for those matters listed in the Exclusions 
from Arbitration clause. Arbitration means that the Dispute will be 
resolved by a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or 
jury.</p>
<p>14.2  Exclusions from Arbitration. </p>
<p>YOU AND THE SONY ENTITIES AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM FILED BY YOU OR BY A 
SONY ENTITY IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE ARBITRATION 
TERMS CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION.</p>
<p>14.3  Opt-Out Right. </p>
<p>YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION
 WAIVER WITHIN 30 DAYS. IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THE BINDING 
ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER IN THIS SECTION, YOU MUST NOTIFY US 
IN WRITING WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE DATE THAT YOU ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT 
UNLESS A LONGER PERIOD IS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW. YOUR WRITTEN 
NOTIFICATION MUST BE MAILED TO 6080 CENTER DRIVE, 10TH FLOOR, LOS 
ANGELES, CA 90045, ATTN: LEGAL DEPARTMENT/ARBITRATION AND MUST INCLUDE: 
(1) YOUR NAME, (2) YOUR ADDRESS, (3) YOUR PSN SERVICES ONLINE ID, IF YOU
 HAVE ONE, AND (4) A CLEAR STATEMENT THAT YOU DO NOT WISH TO RESOLVE 
DISPUTES WITH ANY SONY ENTITY THROUGH ARBITRATION.</p>
<p>14.4  Notice of Dispute. </p>
<p>IF YOU HAVE A DISPUTE WITH ANY SONY ENTITY, YOU MUST SEND WRITTEN 
NOTICE TO 6080 CENTER DRIVE, 10TH FLOOR, LOS ANGELES, CA 90045, ATTN: 
LEGAL DEPARTMENT/ARBITRATION, ATTN: SONY LEGAL DEPARTMENT: DISPUTE 
RESOLUTION, TO GIVE THE SONY ENTITY YOU HAVE A DISPUTE WITH THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO RESOLVE THE DISPUTE INFORMALLY THROUGH NEGOTIATION. You 
agree to negotiate resolution of the Dispute in good faith for no less 
than 60 days after you provide notice of the Dispute. If the Sony Entity
 you have a Dispute with does not resolve your Dispute within 60 days 
from receipt of notice of the Dispute, you or the Sony Entity you have a
 Dispute with may pursue your claim in arbitration pursuant to the terms
 in this section.</p>
<p>14.5  Class Action Waiver. </p>
<p>YOU AND THE SONY ENTITY WITH WHICH YOU HAVE A DISPUTE AGREE THAT 
ARBITRATION WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A 
CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR AS A NAMED OR UNNAMED MEMBER IN A 
CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, 
UNLESS BOTH YOU AND THE SONY ENTITY WITH WHICH YOU HAVE A DISPUTE 
SPECIFICALLY AGREE TO DO SO IN WRITING FOLLOWING INITIATION OF THE 
ARBITRATION. IF APPLICABLE LAW PRECLUDES ENFORCEMENT OF THE LIMITATION 
IS THIS PARAGRAPH AS TO A PARTICULAR REMEDY, THEN A CLAIM SEEKING THAT 
REMEDY (AND ONLY THAT REMEDY) MUST BE SEVERED FROM THE ARBITRATION AND 
BROUGHT IN COURT.  THIS PROVISION DOES NOT PRECLUDE YOUR PARTICIPATION 
AS A MEMBER IN A CLASS ACTION FILED ON OR BEFORE AUGUST 20, 2011. </p>
<p>14.6  Initiation of Arbitration/Selection of Arbitrator. </p>
<p>If you or the Sony Entity you have a Dispute with elect to resolve 
your Dispute through arbitration, the party initiating the arbitration 
proceeding may initiate it with the American Arbitration Association 
("AAA"), www.adr.org, or JAMS www.jamsadr.com. The terms of this section
 govern in the event they conflict with the rules of the arbitration 
organization selected by the parties.</p>
<p>14.7  Arbitration Procedures. </p>
<p>Because the software and/or service provided to you by the Sony 
Entity you have a Dispute with concern interstate commerce, the Federal 
Arbitration Act ("FAA") governs the arbitrability of all Disputes. 
However, applicable federal or state law may also apply to the substance
 of any Disputes. For claims of less than $75,000, the AAA's 
Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes ("Supplementary 
Procedures") shall apply including the schedule of arbitration fees set 
forth in Section C-8 of the Supplementary Procedures; for claims over 
$75,000, the AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules and relevant fee 
schedules for non-class action proceedings shall apply. The AAA rules 
are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Further, if 
your claims do not exceed $75,000 and you provided notice to and 
negotiated in good faith with the Sony Entity you had a Dispute with as 
described above, if the arbitrator finds that you are the prevailing 
party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to recover reasonable 
attorneys' fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator, in addition 
to any rights to recover the same under controlling state or federal law
 afforded to the Sony Entity you have a Dispute with or you. The 
arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a 
statement of reasons unless requested by a party. The award will be 
binding and final, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA, 
and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for
 purposes of enforcement.</p>
<p>14.8  Arbitration Location. </p>
<p>You or the applicable Sony Entity may initiate arbitration in either 
San Mateo County, California or the United States county in which you 
reside. In the event that you select the county of your United States 
residence, the Sony Entity may transfer the arbitration to San Mateo, 
County in the event that it agrees to pay any additional fees or costs 
you incur as a result of the change in location as determined by the 
arbitrator.</p>
<p>14.9  Severability. </p>
<p>If any clause within this arbitration agreement (other than the Class
 Action Waiver clause above) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, 
that clause will be severed from this section, and the remainder of this
 arbitration agreement will be given full force and effect. If the Class
 Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable in its 
entirety, this entire arbitration agreement will be unenforceable, and 
the Dispute will be decided by a court.</p>
<p>14.10  Continuation. </p>
<p>This section survives any termination of this agreement or the provision of PSN Services to you.</p>
<h3>15.  GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION</h3>
<p>The laws of the State of California, without regard to 
conflict-of-law rules, govern this agreement and any dispute between you
 and the Sony Entities. Any dispute not subject to arbitration and not 
initiated in small claims court may be brought by either party in a 
court of competent jurisdiction in either the Superior Courts for the 
State of California in and for the County of San Mateo or in the United 
States District Court for the Northern District of California. Each 
party submits itself to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of those 
courts, and waives all jurisdictional, venue and inconvenient forum 
objections to those courts. In any litigation to enforce any part of 
this agreement, all costs and fees, including attorney's fees, will be 
paid by the non-prevailing party.</p>
<h3>16.  GENERAL LEGAL</h3>

material changes to this agreement are made, you will be notified by 
e-mail or other communication when you sign in to PSN Services. Your 
continued use of PSN Services, including use by your children on the 
associated Accounts, will signify your acceptance of those changes. If 
you do not accept material changes to the agreement, please do not use 
PSN Services, and contact customer service at the addresses located at 
the end of this agreement to terminate this agreement and your Accounts.</p>
<p>16.2  Successors and Assigns. </p>

 our successors in interest. We have the right to assign our rights and

Entity.</p>
