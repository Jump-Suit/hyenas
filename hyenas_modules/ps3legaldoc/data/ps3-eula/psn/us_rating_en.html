<h3>
	<strong>About Ratings</strong>
</h3>
<p>
	Sony Interactive Entertainment provides product descriptions and 
ratings information as a matter of convenience for all users and not as a
 substitute for parental oversight. Parents are encouraged to review 
each piece of content prior to purchase or viewing.
</p>
<p>
	Some content has not been rated by any organization. Parents are 
encouraged to review each piece of content prior to purchase or viewing.
</p>
<h3>
	<strong>About Game Content Ratings in the Americas, except Brazil</strong>
</h3>
<p>
	We understand that it can be difficult to tell which games are 
appropriate for children just by looking at the title. In order to make 
informed purchase decisions, parents and other consumers should check 
the rating of video games. The Entertainment Software Rating Board 
(ESRB) independently applies and enforces ratings adopted by the 
entertainment software industry.
</p>
<p>
	The ESRB rating system has two parts: rating symbols, which are printed
 on the front of each PlayStation game box, and content descriptors, 
which are printed on the back. Rating symbols suggest age 
appropriateness for the game, and content descriptors indicate elements 
in a game that may have triggered a particular rating and/or may be of 
interest or concern.
</p>
<p>
	To take full advantage of the ESRB rating system, it's important to 
check both the rating symbol (on the front of the game box) and the 
content descriptors (on the back of the game box).
</p>
<p>
	<img id="img66" alt="ESRB eC" src="us_rating_en_files/esrb_ec.png" width="54" height="80"><br>
<br>
TITLES RATED EC (Early Childhood) have content that may be suitable for 
persons ages 3 and older. Titles in this category contain no material 
that parents would find inappropriate.
</p>
<p>
	<img id="img67" alt="ESRB E" src="us_rating_en_files/esrb_E.png" width="54" height="80"><br>
<br>
TITLES RATED E (Everyone) have content that may be suitable for persons 
ages 6 and older. Titles in this category may contain minimal cartoon, 
fantasy or mild violence and/or infrequent use of mild language.
</p>
<p>
	<img id="img68" alt="ESRB E10" src="us_rating_en_files/esrb_e10.png" width="54" height="80"><br>
<br>
TITLES RATED E10+ (Everyone 10 and older) have content that may be 
suitable for persons ages 10 and older. Titles in this category may 
contain more cartoon, fantasy or mild violence, mild language, and/or 
minimal suggestive themes.
</p>
<p>
	<img id="img69" alt="ESRB T" src="us_rating_en_files/esrb_t.png" width="54" height="80"><br>
<br>
TITLES RATED T (Teen) have content that may be suitable for persons ages
 13 and older. Titles in this category may contain violence, suggestive 
themes, crude humor, minimal blood and/or infrequent use of strong 
language.
</p>
<p>
	<img id="img70" alt="ESRB M" src="us_rating_en_files/esrb_M.png" width="54" height="80"><br>
<br>
TITLES RATED M (Mature) have content that may be suitable for persons 17
 years and older. Titles in this category may contain violence, blood 
and gore, sexual content, and/or strong language.
</p>
<p>
	<img id="img71" alt="ESRB Ao" src="us_rating_en_files/esrb_Ao.png" width="54" height="80"><br>
<br>
Adults Only or AO ratings are rare. PlayStation does not publish Adults Only games.
</p>
<h3>
	<strong>ESRB Content Descriptors</strong>
</h3>
<p>
	Content descriptors are short, standardized phrases that indicate 
elements in a game that may have triggered a particular rating and, or 
may be of interest or concern. To fully understand what to expect from a
 game, parents should check both the content descriptors and the rating 
symbol.
</p>
<p>
	Following are some of the more frequently used content descriptors on PlayStation games.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Animated Blood - Cartoon or pixilated depictions of blood.
	</li>
	<li>
		Blood- Depictions of blood.
	</li>
	<li>
		Comic Mischief - Scenes depicting slapstick or gross vulgar humor.

	</li>
</ul>

</p>
<h3>
	Monthly Spending Limit
</h3>
<p>
	Set the maximum amount of money that each child can spend per month in PlayStation™Store.<strong> </strong>
</p>
<h3>
	Age Level for Games
</h3>
<p>
	The combination of the parental control level you set for each child on
 your PS4™ system and the parental control level for the game limits 
what games can be played. For example, if you want to restrict use of a 
game with a parental control level of "4", set your PS4 system's 
parental control level one number lower to "3". Setting the parental 
control level on your PS4 system to "3" prohibits users from playing any
 games with a level of "4" or higher.
</p>
<p>
	In addition to [Allowed], there are 11 parental control levels. The 
lower the parental control number, the tighter the restriction. The 
default setting is "9".
</p>
<p>
	You can check parental control levels of games in either of the following ways.<strong> </strong>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Games on discs are sold in packaging that is labeled with rating level
 information. To understand how game rating levels correspond to 
parental control levels, see "Combinations of game rating labels and 
parental control levels".<strong> </strong>
	</li>
	<li>
		To view the parental control level for a game on screen, select the 
game in the content area, press the OPTIONS button, and then select 
[Information]. When a game has age restrictions, the parental control 
level will appear in the [Parental Control] field.<strong> </strong>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>

select a specific age. Select a lower age to tighten the restriction.<strong> </strong>

 who holds a Master Account (See the PlayStation Network Terms of 
Service and User Agreement for details). The Master Account holder can 
restrict a Sub Account's participation in PSN using the settings 
described below. The Master Account can also edit these settings by 
signing in to PSN, then going to (PlayStation Network or PSN) &gt; 
[Account Management] &gt; [Sub Account Management] &gt; [Parental 
Control].
</p>
<p>
	Although PSN parental control settings control an account's activities 
throughout PSN, they restrict content in different ways on different 
PlayStation systems. The PS4 system honors Chat/Message and User 
Generated Media ("UGM") controls (described below) separately. PS3 and 
PS Vita systems honor one control, Chat, that covers the content in both
 categories.
</p>
<p>
	For example, if a Master Account sets the chat parental control on a 
PS3 system to restrict Chat, both Chat/Message and UGM will be 
restricted on a PS4 system. If a Master Account sets the Chat/Message or
 UGM parental control on a PS4 system, both Chat and UGM will be 
restricted on a PS3 system.
</p>
<h3>
	Chat/Message
</h3>
<p>
	This control blocks a Sub Account from using text chat, voice chat, 
video chat, and other messaging features, from communicating directly 
with other users in games or via system software features. Please note 
that when this control is set to block, a Sub Account can still A) send 
and receive predetermined text messages created by a game or app, B) 
create and see other users' in-game character names, designs, and clan 
titles, C) use communication services via the Internet Browser unless 
specifically disabled and D) communicate via system messaging on PS3 and
 PS Vita systems, E) communicate via third party, non-game apps. Please 
use the Grief Report system to report all offensive or inappropriate 
behavior or content.
</p>
<p>
	The default setting is "Block" meaning chat/message is restricted.
</p>
<h3>
	User Generated Media ("UGM")
</h3>
<p>
	This parental control blocks a Sub Account from posting or viewing 
user-generated content (including photos, videos, drawings, and content 
imported from outside sources). This control does not affect content 
shared using chat and messaging functions, which can be disabled using 
the Chat/Message control. This control will not prevent video capture of
 the sub account user's online gameplay.
</p>
<p>
	The default setting is "Block" meaning UGM is restricted.
</p>
<h3>
	Content
</h3>
<p>
	This setting allows a Master Account holder to A) prevent a Sub Account
 from buying game content through PSN that not intended for his/her age 
according to the ESRB rating system and B) prevent a Sub Account from 
playing software content on PSN that is not intended for his age 
according to the ESRB rating system.
</p>
<p>
	The default value is set to "On" meaning content will be restricted based on user age.
</p>
<p>
	If this restriction is removed, a Sub Accounts will be able to buy and 
play any content, including content that is not intended for his/her age
 or may be inappropriate according to the ESRB rating system.
</p>
<h3>
	Monthly Spending Limit
</h3>
<p>
	With this setting, a Master Account holder can set a monthly limit 
spending limit for a Sub Account to spend per month if the Master 
Account wallet has sufficient funds.
