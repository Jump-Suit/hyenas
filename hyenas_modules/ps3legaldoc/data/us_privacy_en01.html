            <h3>Information That We Collect or Receive</h3>
            <p>What data we collect about you</p>
            <p>We collect and receive information from and about you by different means as described below.</p>
            <h4>Information You Provide to Us</h4>
            <p>We collect the information that you directly provide to us, such as when you enter it on our website, or include it in an email that you send to us. This type of collection often occurs through our business support processes, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Registration or PlayStation Network Account (&quot;
                    <strong>Account</strong>&quot;) Creation Processes, where we ask you to provide information such as: Contact info (e.g. name, email or physical address, country, or phone number); Account Administration Info (e.g. user name, password, or security questions); Billing Information (e.g. credit card or other payment number, billing address); Date of Birth; and Profile Info (e.g. profile photo, languages, likes).

For example, when you want to post in a forum, you provide us the content for the post (which could contain PI which we collect and then display for you on the forum). Likewise, when you use other features such as voice or text messaging, blogs, surveys, user-generated content, activity streams, or social media, we may first collect the information you enter into the feature.</p>
            <p>Please make sure that any personal details which you provide are accurate and current. We will send any important information relating to your Account to you using the contact information you provide (including Account security and privacy notices).

            <p>When you create an Account, certain information will form part of your public profile and we will make it accessible to all accounts on PlayStation Network, on the Internet via playstation.com, and some third-party websites, apps or services. This information includes:</p>

The majority of the cases in which we have shared information with police and government authorities concern their investigations into stolen devices, unauthorized use of payment methods, or moderation purposes and safety of PlayStation Network and its users. In a small number of cases, we have also provided information in response to anti-fraud or more serious criminal investigations.</p>
            <h3>Information Handling and Your Choices</h3>
            <p>How we handle your data and your rights</p>
            <h4>Children&#39;s Information</h4>
            <p>We are committed to respecting children&#39;s privacy. We will not collect PI from anyone we have actual knowledge is under the age of 13, without a parent&#39;s consent. If you are creating an account for your child, we recommend that you and your child read our Privacy Information for Young Players to help them understand how we handle their PI and their rights over their PI.</p>
            <p>With parental consent, we will collect, use and share information collected from or about children in accordance with the practices described in this document, with the following exceptions.</p>
            <h4>Information You Provide to Us</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>A parent only needs to provide limited information about their child (an email address and date-of-birth) to create an Account for their child. Providing gender is optional.</li>
                <li>Only with the parent&#39;s approval to create an Account for the child, can a child add their address.</li>
                <li>The spending limit of the Account for your child is set by the associated parent&#39;s Account.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Information You May Choose to Share</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>A parent can control, through the &quot;Free Communication&quot; setting on their child&#39;s Account, their child&#39;s ability to use (and share PI through) text chat, voice chat, video chat, and other messaging features from communicating directly with other users in games, apps or via system software features. Please note that a child&#39;s Account can still (1) send and receive predetermined text messages created by a game or app; (2) create and see other users&#39; in-game character names, designs, and clan titles; (3) use communication services via an Internet browser unless specifically disabled; and (4) communicate via system messaging on PS3 and PS Vita.</li>
                <li>A parent can control their child&#39;s ability to post or view user-generated content, including photos, videos, drawings, and content imported from outside sources (any of which might contain PI) through the user-generated content control. This will not prevent video capture of a child Account user&#39;s online gameplay.</li>
                <li>A parent can agree to our collection and use of their child&#39;s PI without consenting to our disclosure to third parties, except when the disclosure is inherent to the Services we are providing.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When a parent allows their child&#39;s Account to participate in games, chat or user-generated content features, they also consent to SIE sharing information with the publishers of the games, applications, or services that incorporate those features and the collection of information entered into such features by the child&#39;s Account (e.g. typing text into the chat feature).</p>
            <p>If you discover your child under the age of 13 has provided PI to us without your consent, once we verify you are the child&#39;s parent, we will promptly: (a) provide direct notice to you indicating what, if any PI of your child has been collected and how it has been used or disclosed; (b) remove and cease the use of your child&#39;s PI or other information from our database and (c) by notice to you, confirm compliance with the foregoing.</p>
            <h4>International Transfers</h4>
            <p>Our Services are operated in the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, and other countries/areas/regions around the world. Please be aware that information we collect, including PI, will be transferred to, processed and stored in these countries/areas/regions and, as such, courts, law enforcement, and other authorities in these countries may, in certain circumstances, be entitled to access your PI. We ensure there are adequate safeguards in place when transferring your information outside your country by entering contracts with the recipients, European Commission Standard Contractual Clauses or otherwise that the transfer only occurs where permitted by applicable law. By using our Services or providing us with any information through them, you acknowledge this transfer, processing, and storage of your information in these countries in which the privacy laws may not be as comprehensive as those in the country where you reside or are a citizen. </p>
            <h4>Security and Retention</h4>
            <p>We seek to maintain appropriate technical and organizational security measures that conform to industry standards to help protect your information against unauthorized or accidental disclosure, access, misuse, loss, or alteration. Although we strive to protect your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of such information. There is no such thing as perfect security. </p>
            <p>We advise you to make use of the enhanced account access controls that we make available such as 2-Step Verification. Please visit www.playstation.com and/or contact PlayStation Help and Support if you need any assistance in restricting access to your devices or accounts.</p>
            <p>Please keep any passwords and passcodes for your devices and accounts safe and do not disclose them to anyone else. Consider ensuring automatic account log-in setting is disabled and the setting requiring a password to be entered before completing purchases is enabled, particularly if your PlayStation device is shared with others. You should contact PlayStation Support immediately if you become aware of any unauthorized use of your accounts or other security breaches.</p>
            <p>We may retain information about you as long as it is necessary for us to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy. In addition, we may retain your information for an additional period as is permitted or required to, among other things, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. Where required by applicable law, we shall delete your information when the information is no longer necessary or requested to do so. Even if we delete your information from active databases, the information may remain on backup or archival media as well as other information systems. </p>
            <h4>Your Choices and Rights</h4>
            <h4>Your Choices</h4>
            <p>You may have certain choices about how your information is collected, used, stored, and shared.  These options can be accessed through your Account or device settings.  Please ensure that your information is up-to-date. Among others, you have the following choices:</p>

                <li>Personalized communications: Whether we may use the information we have collected, to personalize emails and notifications.</li>

            </ul>
            <h4>Do Not Track (DNT)</h4>
            <p>&quot;Do Not Track&quot; is an internet browser setting regarding tracking. As there are currently no agreed upon standards for the DNT signals or how to respond to them, we adhere to the standards set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>

            <p>In addition to the rights described below, you can also access, amend or delete some information through your Account Settings page.</p>

            </ul>
            <p>In some cases, your choices to provide, change or delete information may affect our ability to deliver our Services, or your user experience. We may decline to process requests which are not otherwise required by applicable law. You have the right not to be unlawfully discriminated against because you have exercised these rights.</p>
