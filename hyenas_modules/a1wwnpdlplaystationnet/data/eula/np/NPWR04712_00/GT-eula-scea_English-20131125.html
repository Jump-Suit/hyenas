<h4>SOFTWARE PRODUCT LICENSE AGREEMENT</h4>
</center>

BY PURCHASING, DOWNLOADING OR USING THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT ("SOFTWARE"), YOU AGREE
TO THE TERMS OF THIS SOFTWARE PRODUCT LICENSE AGREEMENT ("AGREEMENT").&nbsp; If
you do not agree to the terms of this Agreement, do not purchase, download or
use the Software.

</p>

Please read this entire Agreement, which governs your use of the Software.&nbsp; This
Agreement is between the publisher of the Software (&quot;Licensor&quot;) and
you. The identity of Licensor can be found on the packaging for physical
products (e.g., the Blu-ray game disc box) or on the online store page for
downloadable products (e.g., PlayStation&reg;Store game page).&nbsp; This Agreement
applies to you unless you and Licensor enter into a separate, valid license
agreement, in which case the terms of that separate license agreement will
govern.

</p>

If Licensor is Sony Computer Entertainment America LLC ("SCEA"), this Agreement is
between you and SCEA. If Licensor is not SCEA, then (a) Licensor, not SCEA, is
solely responsible for the Software; and (b) SCEA is a third-party beneficiary
of this Agreement, which means that SCEA has the right to enforce the terms of
the Agreement against you.

Agreement shall be held invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, such
provision shall be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid
and enforceable, and the validity and enforceability of all other provisions of
this Agreement shall not be affected thereby.&nbsp; This Agreement constitutes
the entire agreement between the parties related to the subject matter hereof
and supersedes all prior oral and written and all contemporaneous oral
negotiations, commitments and understandings of the parties, all of which are
merged herein.&nbsp; Sections 4, 5 and 6 survive the termination of this
Agreement.</li>

<H4>IF LICENSOR IS SCEA, SECTIONS 6 AND 7 APPLY.</H4>

<li><b>BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION FOR CERTAIN RESIDENTS.</b>
<ol type="a">
<li>The following terms in this Section 6, to the fullest extent permitted under law,
only apply to you if you are a resident of the United States or a country in
North, Central or South America.</li></p>

<li>The term &quot;Dispute&quot; means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you
and SCEA or any Sony affiliate (&quot;Sony Entity&quot;) regarding the use of
the Software, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort
(including fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), or
any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability
or scope of this Section 6 (with the exception of the enforceability of the
Class Action Waiver clause below).&nbsp; &quot;Dispute&quot; has the broadest
possible meaning that will be enforced.</li></p>

<li>If you have a Dispute (other than one described as excluded from arbitration below)
with any Sony Entity or a Sony Entity's officers, directors, employees and
agents (&quot;Adverse Sony Entity&quot;) that cannot be resolved through
negotiation as required below, you and the Adverse Sony Entity must seek
resolution of the Dispute only through arbitration of that Dispute according to
Section 6's terms, and not litigate that Dispute in court.&nbsp; Arbitration
means that the Dispute will be resolved by a neutral arbitrator instead of in a
court by a judge or jury.</li></p>

<li>YOU AND THE SONY ENTITITY AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM FILED BY YOU OR BY A SONY ENTITY IN
SMALL CLAIMS COURT IS NOT SUBJECT TO THE ARBITRATION TERMS CONTAINED IN THIS
SECTION 6.</li></p>

<li>IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THE BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER IN
THIS SECTION 6, YOU MUST NOTIFY SCEA IN WRITING WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE DATE THAT
YOU ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT.&nbsp; YOUR WRITTEN NOTIFICATION MUST BE MAILED TO
SONY COMPUTER ENTERTAINMENT AMERICA LLC, 2207
BRIDGEPOINTE PARKWAY, SAN MATEO, CA
94404, ATTN: LEGAL DEPARTMENT - WAIVER, AND MUST INCLUDE: (1) YOUR
NAME, (2) YOUR ADDRESS, (3) YOUR SIGN IN ID IF YOU HAVE ONE, AND (4) A CLEAR
STATEMENT THAT YOU DO NOT WISH TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH ANY SONY ENTITY THROUGH
ARBITRATION.</li></p>

<li>IF YOU HAVE A DISPUTE WITH ANY
SONY ENTITY, YOU MUST SEND WRITTEN NOTICE TO SONY COMPUTER ENTERTAINMENT
AMERICA LLC, 2207 BRIDGEPOINTE PARKWAY, SAN MATEO, CA 94404, ATTN: LEGAL
DEPARTMENT &#8211; DISPUTE RESOLUTION, TO GIVE THE ADVERSE SONY ENTITY AN OPPORTUNITY
TO RESOLVE THE DISPUTE INFORMALLY THROUGH NEGOTIATION.</li></p>

<li>You agree to negotiate resolution of the Dispute in good faith for no fewer than 60
days after you provide notice of the Dispute.&nbsp; If the Adverse Sony Entity
does not resolve your Dispute within 60 days from its receipt of notice of the
Dispute, you or the Adverse Sony Entity may pursue your claim in arbitration
pursuant to the terms in this Section 6.</li></p>

<li>ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR COURT, WILL BE
CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE
ACTION OR AS A NAMED OR UNNAMED MEMBER IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE
OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, UNLESS BOTH YOU AND THE ADVERSE SONY ENTITY
SPECIFICALLY AGREE TO DO SO IN WRITING FOLLOWING INITIATION OF THE
ARBITRATION.</li></p>

<li>If you or the Adverse Sony
Entity elect to resolve your Dispute through arbitration, the party initiating
the arbitration proceeding may initiate it with the American Arbitration
Association (&quot;AAA&quot;),<a href="http://www.adr.org/">www.adr.org</a>, or
JAMS, <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/">www.jamsadr.com</a>. This
Section 6's terms govern if they conflict with the rules of the arbitration
organization that the parties select.</li></p>

<li>The Federal Arbitration Act
(&quot;FAA&quot;) governs the arbitrability of all disputes involving
interstate commerce. However, applicable federal or state law may also apply to
the substance of a Dispute. For claims of less than $75,000, the AAA's
Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (&quot;Supplementary
Procedures&quot;) apply including the schedule of arbitration fees set forth in
section C-8 of the Supplementary Procedures; for claims over $75,000, the AAA's
Commercial Arbitration Rules and relevant fee schedules for non-class action
proceedings apply.</li></p>

<li>The AAA rules are available at <a href="http://www.adr.org/">www.adr.org</a> or by calling <a href="tel:1-800-778-7879">1-800-778-7879</a>.
Further, if your claims do not exceed $75,000 and you provided notice to and negotiated in good faith
with the Adverse Sony Entity as described above, if the arbitrator finds that
you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to
recover reasonable attorneys' fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator,
in addition to any rights to recover the same under controlling state or
federal law afforded to the Adverse Sony Entity or you.</li></p>

<li>The arbitrator will make any
award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested
by a party.&nbsp; The arbitrator's award will be binding and final, except for
any right of appeal provided by the FAA, and may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.</li></p>

<li>You or the Adverse Sony Entity may initiate arbitration in either San Mateo County,
California or the county in which you reside.&nbsp; If you select the county of
your residence, the Adverse Sony Entity may transfer the arbitration to San
Mateo, County if it agrees to pay any additional fees or costs you incur as a
result of the change in location as determined by the arbitrator.</li></p>

<li>If any clause within this Section 6 (other than the Class Action Waiver clause above)
is illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Section 6,
and the remainder of this Section 6 will be given full effect.&nbsp; If the
Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire
Section 6 will be unenforceable, and the Dispute will be decided by a court.</li>

<li>This Section 6 survives this Agreement's termination.</li>
