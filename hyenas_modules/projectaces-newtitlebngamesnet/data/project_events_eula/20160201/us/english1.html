SHALL BANDAI NAMCO, ITS PARENT, SUBSIDIARIES, SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS OR

 online, multi-player or downloadable portions of the Game or continued

specific legal rights and you may also have other legal rights which 
vary from state to state.</p>
<p>7.3 BANDAI NAMCO is not liable for any delay or failure to perform

EULA, BANDAI NAMCO shall have the right, at its sole discretion, to 
either terminate or suspend immediately this EULA or decrease your 
allocation of awarded points without notice. You have no property or 
ownership interest in points awarded through the Game. If BANDAI NAMCO

agreement were not specifically enforced, you agree that BANDAI NAMCO 
and/or its licensors shall be entitled, without bond, other security or 
proof of damages, to appropriate equitable remedies with respect to 
breaches of this agreement, in addition to such other remedies as BANDAI
 NAMCO may otherwise have under applicable laws.<br><br>
 12. INDEMNITY.<br>
 You agree to indemnify, defend and hold BANDAI NAMCO, its licensors and

<p>13. BINDING ARBITRATION.<br>
  Except for any action by BANDAI NAMCO seeking injunctive relief with 
respect to any violation of BANDAI NAMCO’s intellectual property rights 
by you (including in connection with any use by you of the Game in an 
authorized manner), any dispute between you and BANDAI NAMCO involving 
this agreement shall be settled by binding arbitration in accordance 
with the then-in-effect Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures 
of JAMS (the “<em><u>Rules</u></em>”) which can be found at 
http://www.jamsadr.com. The venue of the arbitration and any related 
proceedings shall be located in Santa Clara County, California or the 
largest metropolitan area that is within one hundred and fifty (150) 
miles of the party initiating the arbitration. If you initiate an 
arbitration proceeding against BANDAI NAMCO you will be required to pay a
 portion of the JAMS fee up to two hundred and fifty dollars ($250). If 
BANDAI NAMCO initiates an arbitration proceeding against you the JAMS 
fees will be paid by BANDAI NAMCO. There shall be a panel of three 
neutral arbitrators, selected in accordance with the Rules. Any 
unresolved discovery disputes may be brought to and disposed of by the 
chair of the arbitration panel. Disputes with respect to the admission, 
rejection and consideration of evidence shall be governed by the Federal
 Rules of Civil Procedure and applicable Federal law. The arbitration 
panel shall choose California law as the applicable substantive law and 
its award and decision shall conform to such law. The decision and award
 of the arbitration panel may be by majority. The arbitration award and 
decision shall be in writing and shall specify the factual and legal 
bases for the award and decision. Except where prohibited by law, the 
arbitrators may award the arbitrators’ and administrative fees and 
out-of-pocket expenses to the prevailing party. The arbitrator(s) shall 
have no authority to resolve any claims on a class or representative 
basis; the arbitrator(s) may not consolidate or join the claims of other
 persons or parties who may be similarly situated; and the arbitrator(s)
 shall not have the power to award punitive damages against any party. 
The prevailing party may enforce the award and decision in any court of 
competent jurisdiction.<br><br>
 14. GOVERNING LAW; MISCELLANEOUS.<br>
  Any dispute not subject to arbitration (other than claims proceeding 
in any small claims court), or where no election to arbitrate has been 
made, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the 
County of Santa Clara, State of California, United States of America, 
and you and BANDAI NAMCO agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of
 that court. Except as otherwise set forth herein, this EULA shall be 
governed by, and will be construed under, the laws of the United States 
of America and the law of the State of California, without regard to 
choice of law principles. The UN Convention on Contracts for the 
International Sale of Goods is expressly disclaimed. If any term or 
provision of this agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such
 provision shall be struck and the remaining provisions shall remain in 
effect and be enforced as if the invalid or unenforceable provision were
 not contained herein. BANDAI NAMCO’s failure to act with respect to a 
breach by you or others does not waive its right to act with respect to 
subsequent or similar breaches. You may not assign or transfer this 
agreement or your rights hereunder, and any attempt to the contrary is 
void. This agreement sets forth the entire understanding and agreement 
between BANDAI NAMCO and you with respect to the subject matter hereof. <br><br>
 15. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER TERMS OF USE.<br>
  This EULA applies to all online service, content, Games, and products,
 and may be incorporated in to additional Game-specific terms of use. In
 the event of a conflict between this EULA and a Game-specific terms of 
use document, this EULA shall control (unless specifically stated 
otherwise in the Game-specific terms of use).<br>
